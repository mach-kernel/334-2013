Donatella (FRC 2013 Software)
========

## What is it?

This is the competition program for 'Donatella', the 2013 Ultimate Ascent bot built by FRC Team 334 from Brooklyn Technical High School.

It is written in [Java ME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition) for the [CompactRIO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompactRIO) microcontroller. I'm sure you already knew that!

## Cool! How do I use it?

### Requirements

You'll need:

* [The Eclipse IDE](http://eclipse.org/)
* [WPILibJ for Eclipse:](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/java/eclipse/update/) Add this as a software source and then install the FRC packages.
* Git

### How-to

1. Open your favorite shell (this works on Windows too) and do:
```
git clone git@github.com:mach-kernel/334-2013.git
```
2. Import the project into Eclipse.
3. Fix your build path (this is most likely broken if your eclipse directory is not C:\eclipse\ or if you're not using Windows).
4. Set your team number within the FRC preferences
5. ???
6. Profit!
